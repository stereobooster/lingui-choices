# Lingui choices

I like [Lingui](https://lingui.js.org). It is very nice to work with, but there are still some tricky parts. When you use Lingui you need to make some choice, which takes some time and depending on those choices developer experience can degrade, you can get into weird edge cases (caveats).

This is a small **experimental** application which will help you to model those choices.

This is the treatment of symptoms not a solution to the problem. Propper solution would be:

- eliminate choices (as much as possible)
- eliminate caveats
- recommend a preferred way for each choice
